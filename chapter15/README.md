# Advanced 2D Graphics
This chapter presents two advanced and powerful techniques to improve a game's graphipcs, namely particle effects and shader programs.

## Particle Systems
>A particle system is a technique in game physics, motion graphics, and computer graphics that uses many minute sprites, 3D models, or other graphic objects to simulate certain kinds of "fuzzy" phenomena, which are otherwise very hard to reproduce with conventional rendering techniques - usually highly chaotic systems, natural phenomena, or processes caused by chemical reactions. --<cite>[wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_system)</cite>

Simply put a particle effect is a collection of images/sprites put together to resemble a wanted animation. Animations such as fire, smoke, explosions, electrical sparks, rain, snow, droplets.

### The LibGDX Particle Editor
Make sure the particle editor is of the same version as the rest of your project, as it may be subject to breaking changes.
