# Maze Game
This chapter examines how to develop a maze-based game, where the character is to collect all the coins in a maze whilst avoiding a ghost. The chapter expositions algorithm on how to generate random mazes using a depth-first algorithm, aswell as finding the shortest path to the character from  the ghost using a breadth-first algorithm

As suggested by the book the following features have been added:
* Added a menu screen
* Added more audio effects
* Added a timer to the UI
* Increasing ghost speed with time
* Hero health points
* Added more ghosts
* Implemented a larger maze

Bonus features:
