# "Java Game Development with LibGDX"
These projects are Professor Lee Stemkoski's from the book ["Java Game Development with LibGDX"](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484233238).

In no way do I claim ownership of the code or assets used to make the code run.
This is simply for my own training and recreation.

The code is converted from Java to Kotlin.
